## Data Collection
Feature | Description
--- | --- 
**mpg** | Miles / US Gallon
disp    | Displacement - Measures the overall volume in the engine as a factor of cylinder circumfrance, depth and total number of cylinders. ‘Proxy for the total amount of power the engine can generate.’ 
hp      |	Horsepower
drat    | Rear Axle Ratio - The number of turns of the drive shaft for every one rotation of the wheel axle
wt      |	Weight (lb/1000)
qsec    |	1/4 time - A performance measure, primarily of acceleration
vs      | Engine Cylinder Configuration - (VShape = 0 | StraightLine = 1)
am      | Transmission Type - (Auto = 0 | Manual = 1)
gear    | Number of Forward Gears - Auto = (3 | 4), Manual = (4 | 5)
carb    | Number of Carburetors - Engines with higher displacement typically have higher barrel configuration
